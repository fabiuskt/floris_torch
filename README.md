# FLORIS Wake Modeling and Wind Farm Controls Software - PyTorch implementation

PyTorch implementation of FLORIS (Gauss model only.) Simplified version of FLORIS based on https://github.com/bayc/floris/blob/feature/vectorize/examples/_getting_started/floriz_ez_gauss.py. See https://github.com/NREL/floris for more details about FLORIS.

PyTorch implementation of wind farm control from a neural net trained by differentiating through FLORIS. This is akin to Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC) using a steady state model.
